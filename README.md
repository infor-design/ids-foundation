# Overview

Contains base tokens, font files and foundational assets for the Ids design system.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are pieces of data that represent foundational styles in the design system. They simplify the way product teams interpret and apply the design language, resulting in more cohesive, scalable interfaces. Find more info in the [design system](https://design.infor.com/foundations/design-tokens/). This guide just covers how to use them in the context of this repo and things like exporting / consuming.

### Types

Tokens are categorized by whichever foundational style thatâ€™s applied.

| Token       |                               |Example         |Status         |

## Using the tokens

At the moment we have sass files for the tokens which are css variables. We may provide other formats as needed. To use the components either:

1. Take the core, semantic files from https://github.com/infor-design/ids-foundation/tree/main/tokens/theme-soho (Component tokens https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/tree/main/src/themes/default in the source)
2. Use the npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/ids-foundation
