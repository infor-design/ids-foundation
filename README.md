# Overview

Contains base tokens, semantic tokens, font files and foundational assets for IDS.

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are pieces of data that represent foundational styles in the design system. They simplify the way product teams interpret and apply the design language, resulting in more cohesive, scalable interfaces. Find more info in the [design system](https://design.infor.com/foundations/design-tokens/). This guide just covers how to use them in the context of this repo and things like exporting / consuming.

### Types

Tokens are categorized by the foundational style thatâ€™s applied.

| Token       |                               |Example         |Status         |
|-------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------|
|**color**    |Defines fills for backgrounds, text, icons, and borders |`color-background-default`| Included |
|**radius**   |Defines border radii for surfaced  for backgrounds, text, icons, and borders |`border-radius-xs`| Included |
|**spacing**  |Defines scalable padding and margin units for grids and layouts  |`space-xl`| Included |
|**font**     |Defines typography attributes like font families, weights, sizes, and line height |`font-size-label`| Future |
|**border**   |Defines stroke widths, styles, and radiuses  |`border-style-dashed`| Future |
|**size**     |Defines other reusable values for heights, widths, and breakpoints  |`size-70`| Future |
|**shadow**   |Defines box shadow properties like offsets, blur, and color |`shadow-error`| Future |
|**motion**   |Defines animations during certain interaction states  |`motion-ease`| Future |

### Using the Tokens

#### Code

Sass files for the tokens are provided as CSS variables. We may provide other formats as needed.

To use the components:

1. Take the core and semantic tokens from [/ids-foundation](https://github.com/infor-design/ids-foundation/tree/main/tokens/theme-soho). View [component tokens](https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise-wc/tree/main/src/themes/default) in @infor-design/enterprise-wc.
2. Use the [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ids-foundation).

#### Design

Semantic tokens can be manually applied in Figma by adding the [IDS Design Tokens](https://www.figma.com/design/7xMSXwCpK3eq4uGqkDDDav/IDS-Design-Tokens?m=auto&node-id=16%3A396&t=VDCzgpqVzBEcmjt5-1) library. Tokenized Figma components will available in the future.
